The goal of this project is to build a software-defined DVB-T2
transmitter, based on the EN 302 755 V1.3.1 Frame structure with
lower latency than the standard DVB-T2 blocks in GNU Radio.


Build instructions:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../
    make
    sudo make install
    sudo ldconfig

Contributions are welcome!
